Process:
Image then it goes through pre-processing then OCR
OCR(Optical Character Recognition) is basically a traditional text conversion by  using ML And NN helps in understanding hanwriting and converts them to machine-encoded text.
Ocr has higher accuracy

After OCR converts into Text it goes through LLM Evaluation (We are using Ollama Local model) 
Then it gives score and result or feedback



Modules:
1) htr_engine.py
handels handwritten text extraction. Converts the uploaded image into grayscale and uses OCR to convert processed image to text.

We use grayscale because handwriting varies in lighting and contrast. Also converting to grayscale reduces dimensionality and improves text-background Separation to improve OCR accuracy

2) evaulator.py 
This module sends the extracted text to a local LLM running via Ollama.
constructs a prompt that includes the question and student answer, then requests scoring and feedback.

3) main.py (UI)
We used streamlit which allows image upload, question input and display extracted text and evaulation results
